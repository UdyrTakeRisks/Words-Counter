Note: If you don't have the g++ compiler you should download the MinGW C++ compiler from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/ , it contains the g++ then add it in the environmnet variables -> system variables scroll for Path then double click it and click New then write C:\MinGW\bin then press OK in all open windows to save the changes, have fun!

# Words-Counter

- In the program directory, open the cmd

# Compile it using

- g++ main.cpp -o main.exe

# Run it using 

- main.exe (windows)
- ./main (linux)

I pushed also the main.exe so you can run it directly but it's not guaranteed if you haven't the compiler, Thank you.

# How to use

- Put any text file with the extension [.txt] in the program directory and when prompted in code, enter the name of the file only then press enter
- I provided a text file sample named WordCounter you can try it first, Thank you.
